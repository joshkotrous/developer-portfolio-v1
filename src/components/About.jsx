            Currently working for Neostella as the Development Manager, I am a software developer focused on constantly learning new things and expanding my abilities. I am particularly experienced in implementing automations to complete complex business processes and leading high-performing software delivery teams. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Most recently I've been focused on honing my full-stack development skills using React and Python to build maintainable, scalable, and responsive web applications.

      Currently working for Neostella as the Development Manager, I am a
      software developer focused on constantly learning new things and expanding
      my abilities. I am particularly experienced in implementing automations to
      complete complex business processes and leading high-performing software
      delivery teams.
      <br />
      <br />
      Most recently I&apos;ve been focused on honing my full-stack development
      skills using React and Python to build maintainable, scalable, and
      responsive web applications.
